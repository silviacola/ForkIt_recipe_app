     '48 ounce Piedmontese brisket flat, 2 onions, 3 carrots, 2 fresh bay leaves, 1 sprig fresh rosemary, 4 to 5 juniper berries, 1 bottle barolo, 3 tbs butter, 4 tbsp virgin olive oil, ½ cup dry Marsala wine or cognac, 2 tbsp flour.',
     'Put all the vegetables and spices in a bowl, add the beef and cover with the wine. Refrigerate overnight, or a minimum of 10 hours. Heat a heavy-bottom pot, large enough to hold the beef and wine, over medium-high heat. Melt half of the butter with all of the oil. Take the beef out of the marinade, season it with salt and pepper, and brown it in the hot pot on all sides. Using a slotted spoon, take out all the vegetables from the wine and add them to the beef, stirring until they color a bit. Add the wine to the pan, turn the heat down and cover with a lid. Simmer for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally and turning the beef. Pour the Marsala or cognac into the stew, and let cook a few more minutes. Take the beef out of the pan and set it on a carving board. Remove and discard the bay leaves and juniper berries. To strain the broth, put the wine and vegetables in a food mill or pour through a fine mesh sieve, applying pressure to the vegetables to extract all the juice. Reserve the juice and the vegetable puree. In a saucepan, melt the remaining butter. Add the flour and cook for a few minutes, being careful not to brown the mixture. Add the wine and vegetable puree and cook for a bit longer, until the sauce thickens slightly. Slice the meat against the grain, arrange it on a serving plate, and pour the very hot wine sauce on top. Serve this the traditional way, with polenta, or if you prefer, mashed potatoes.',

     '460',
     'Salt, 3 whole fresh small red chiles, 1 cup EVO oil, 4 garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped Italian parsley, 1 pound linguine or spaghetti.',
     'Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into 1/4-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is al dente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid. When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.',

     'Easy',

     '12 lamb chops, 1 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves, 1 tbsp fresh mint leaves, 1 tsp lemon zest, 2 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp EVO oil, 1/4 cup fine sea salt, 1 tbsp freshly-ground black pepper.',
     'In a bowl, combine the salt, sugar, pepper, lemon zest, mint, and rosemary. Cover the chops with the rub, and let them stand at room temperature for up to 2 hours, or refrigerate covered for up to a day. To grill the chops, fire up the grill to high heat. Season the chops lightly with olive oil. Place as many chops as you can fit onto the grill without crowding. Cook, turning once, until the chops are well seared outside and rosy pink in the center. This will vary based on your grill’s heat but should be at least 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter, and serve piping hot. ',
